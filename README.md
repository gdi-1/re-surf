<br>re:surf
</h1>
 
a fork of re:squake that adds surfing on stairs to the mod. requires [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin), depends on [YetAnotherConfigLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl), [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) and optionally [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).

this mod works fine if installed only on the client, but in order to prevent fall damage from slowing down the player it must be installed on the server too. players can toggle the mod individually in the settings, or using the keybind.
